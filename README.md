# Credit-Card-Detection

Fraud detection is a critical real-world problem where billions of dollars are lost each year. This project uses machine learning techniques in Python to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is not only to classify transactions accurately but also to minimize false negatives.

## 📁 Dataset

Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (2013 European transactions)

## What it does
This project evaluates the model using metrics that are appropriate for imbalanced datasets:
1. Precision
2. Recall
3. F1-score
4. Confusion Matrix
5. AUPRC (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve) — recommended by dataset creators
6. ROC-AUC

## Conclusion

This project successfully builds a fraud detection model with:
1. Strong classification metrics
2. Meaningful analysis of a highly imbalanced dataset
3. Proper handling of fraud rarity
4. Model performance validated using AUPRC and recall
